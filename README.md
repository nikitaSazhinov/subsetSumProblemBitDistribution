# Subset Sum Problem and Bit Distribution
The partition problem is an NP-Complete problem commonly found in the field of computer science, and engineering due to its use for task scheduling. Research has been conducted on heuristic and exact algorithms of the partition problems, as well as the particular instance hardness. The ratio of number of input set elements and the average number of bits to represent the input set has been found to have an effect on the instance hardness. In this paper this ratio is kept at a constant, in order to investigate how the bit distribution of the input set affects the hardness. The results show that the bit distribution affects instance hardness when evaluated with both, exact and heuristic algorithms.
